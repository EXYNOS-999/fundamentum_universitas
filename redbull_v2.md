UNIVERSITY LIFE @ YOUR FINGERTIPS

https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwIkgD0=/




We are proposing a decentralized software application (d-App) that will connect the students over all aspects of their university life. This app will be based on a decentralized blockchain network.
The primary service of this app will be to securely connect students in close proximity to each other without having to connect to the internet via WiFi or mobile network. In short, it will establish a secure peer-to-peer connection among the students.
The objective here is to gather the entire experience of the university life into a single app. To demonstrate this, we have divided the services that this app will provide into 4 categories that will cover all aspects of the students’ university life: Academic, Social, Personal and Identity.
Academic: Students’ can securely access their transcripts through this app. Furthermore, they will be able to look at scholarship opportunities, share notes among each other in real time and access career counselling portals. High-achieving students will be able to help out other students in a secure and anonymous manner.
Moreover, educator such as teachers and teaching assistants will be able to share their course handouts and other lecture materials with students in real-time. The school alumni will also be able to access the system so that students can network better, which is a challenge right now.
Social: The decentralized nature of the app will allow students to have anonymous chat with each other. They will be able to access their social news feeds securely and invite other students to join groups for various team tasks. In addition, this app will allow the prediction of university student group hotspots.
