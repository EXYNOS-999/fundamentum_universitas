We are proposing a decentralized software application (d-App) that will connect the students over all aspects of their university life. This app will be based on a decentralized blockchain network.The primary service of this app will be to securely connect students in close proximity to each other without having to connect to the internet via WiFi or mobile network. In short, it will establish a secure peer-to-peer connection among the students.The objective here is to gather the entire experience of the university life into a single app. To demonstrate this, we have divided the services that this app will provide into 4 categories that will cover all aspects of the students’ university life: Academic, Social, Personal and Identity.Academic: Students’ can securely access their transcripts through this app. Furthermore, they will be able to look at scholarship opportunities, share notes among each other in real time and access career counselling portals. High-achievingstudents will be able to help out other students in a secure and anonymous manner.Moreover, educator such as teachers and teaching assistants will be able to share their course handouts and other lecture materials with students in real-time. The school alumni will also be able to access the system so that students can network better, which is a challenge right now.Social: The decentralized nature of the app will allow students to have anonymous chat with each other. They will be able to access their social news feeds securely and invite other students to join groups for various team tasks. In addition, this app will allow the prediction of university student group hotspots.Personal: Students with mental health issues will be able to securely connect with other helper students and even health professionals without the fear of having to reveal their identity if they are uncomfortable. This is still a challenge even though the universities try to take measures in protecting students’ identities. With proper connectivity between peers/classmates/friends, time management will be much easier for students, especially during exams. They can form closed study groups in a secure manner if they want to. This app will also enable organizing small-scale competitions among students. For example, they will be able to plug in certain gamification task to increase their productivity.Identity: Students will have unique digital identities that will be governed by the decentralized blockchain network. This will lead to proper access and execution of various services that need secure access and anonymity. For example, students will be able to cast their votes (say during an interim election) online where the votes will not be linked to their actual user/student IDs but to random public IP addresses that they will be assigned to during the event. The identity aspect of this d-App will also lead to providing capabilities for further services such as attendance tracking, tracking and evacuation process during emergencies and access to secure locations within the university perimeter with less overhead for the university’s security administration.
This is an all-in-one mobile application that will provide more secure and efficient ways for university students, educators, alumni and the administration to connect with each other and receive/provide services. Overall, this will be entire the university life at everyone’s fingertips.
